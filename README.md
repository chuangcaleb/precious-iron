# Precious Iron

> Lengthened early-game stone-to-iron technology progression!

## Rationale

Mojang

## Core Module

### Furnace Nerf

The following changes to Furnace smelting recipes have been made:

- Raw Iron → Iron Nugget
- Raw Gold → Gold Nugget

The Ore/Deepslate Ore/Nether Ore variants also produce one nugget for parity.

Note: Since Copper has no nugget form (lol Mojang), any form of raw Copper is unable to be smelted in the Furnace.

Blast Furnace blasting recipes are untouched!

This means that to get a full set of iron armor with just a Furnace, you will need 243 Raw Iron, or 3.51 stacks.

### Chain Tier

Chains are now crafted with the following recipe, which produces 3 Chains.

|             |             |             |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
|             | iron nugget |             |
| iron nugget |             | iron nugget |
|             | iron nugget |             |

This means that a full set of Chainmail armor can be acquired with 36 Raw Iron, or 0.56 stacks.

### Harder Blast Furnace Recipe

The new Blast Furnace Recipe is like this:

| | | |
| ------------ | ---------- | ------------ |
| deepslate    | calcite    | deepslate    |
| deepslate    | furnace    | deepslate    |
| smooth stone | iron block | smooth stone |

With just a Furnace, this costs 81 Raw Iron, or 1.27 stacks. Of course, you can still acquire Iron from Shipwrecks or even find Blast Furnaces in Villages.

The added Deepslate and Calcite (and the load of iron) in the recipe requires players to go spelunking quite a bit before *unlocking* iron. Deepslate is only found in lower levels, while Calcite is only found on Amethyst Geodes. The Iron Block is for players who luck out on the first two, so that they still need to do a bit of grinding.

It will be worth it for players to get at least some Chainmail armor before going on a treasure hunt for all these items. That creates an extra keyframe in their adventure story!

### Breaking Blast Furnaces

Blast Furnaces can be readily generated and found and used in Villages.

So, this pack also makes it so that you need Iron Pickaxe or better to obtain the Blast Furnace upon breaking it. This means that if you haven't obtained an Iron Pickaxe, you can't just steal the Village's Blast Furnace.

### Miscellaneous (and recaps)

- Added blast furnace recipe for Calcite to be renewable, since it is an ingredient for a very core block
  - Blast Furnace: Amethyst Block → Calcite
- Added requirement for Blast Furnaces to require Iron Pickaxe or better to obtain upon breaking
- Added recipe unlocks for the Chainmail armor pieces upon picking up Iron Nuggets
- Added overriding recipe unlocks for Chain (trigger: Iron Nugget), Blast Furnace (trigger: Furnace)
- Removed Furnace smelting recipes for all raw copper forms
